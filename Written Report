-All of the charter schools have overall passing rates of at least 89, while all of the district schools are below average.

-Most of the charter school have lower budgets and spending rates and the district schools
-All but one of the district schools are in the top 2 spending bins, the lowest spending one has the highest passing rate but only by a small margin
-All but one of the charter schools are in the bottom 2 spending bins, the higher spending didnt have an impact on grades or passing rate

-Overall, scores and passing rates go down as the spending rates get higher

-Small and medium schools seem to have higher scores and passing rates than large schools
-However, the only "large" charter school had similar scores and passing rates to other charter schools
